"""End-of-match awards: HP's award ids → the game's award keys, learned by the server itself.

HP names an award by its own id; a /replay/{id} answer also gives the award's title and icon, so an
id the shipped table lacks is resolved there (title first, then icon) and remembered in
`hp_award_map`. Match lists keep HP's id and are named when served, so a learned id reaches lists
cached before it was learned.
